# SwiftUI-radio-player

SwiftUI-radio-player is an app to listen to a dynamic number of radio stations obtained from a JSON. Some of its features include:

- Dynamic carousel with the ability to tap on an item to display the description of the selected radio station.
- Dynamic theme that changes depending on the chosen radio station.
- Interactive progress bar to rewind in the streaming or return to the live stream.
- Ability to mark a radio station as a favorite so that it appears in the first position when opening the app.
- Media player system controls on notification screen.
- Integration with AirPlay.
